# Diversity-and-Inclusion
The dashboard consists of several key components that address various aspects of diversity and inclusion within the organization. It starts with an overview section, which provides a high-level snapshot of the organization's diversity composition and any associated goals. This sets the context for the rest of the dashboard.
Employee Demographics is a critical section that visually represents the distribution of employees based on gender, age, ethnicity, and other relevant categories. This helps identify any disparities or underrepresented groups, facilitating a better understanding of the workforce's composition.
The Hiring and Recruitment section focuses on evaluating the organization's diversity-focused recruitment practices. It displays metrics such as the number of applicants, diversity of applicants, and the percentage of diverse candidates hired. This data helps assess the effectiveness of diversity initiatives in the hiring process.
Retention and Promotion is another important area covered in the dashboard. It analyzes retention rates and promotion rates across different demographic groups, allowing the organization to identify any imbalances and areas that require attention. This information aids in creating strategies to foster an inclusive environment and equal opportunities for growth.
